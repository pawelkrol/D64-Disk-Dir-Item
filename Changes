Revision history for Perl extension D64::Disk::Dir::Item.

0.06  2013-03-04
    - bug fixed: printing out a directory item in PETSCII mode was previously
      only spitting out an item data instead of properly formatted disk entry
    - enhanced "type_to_string" subroutine with the possibility of converting
      file type also into PETSCII string representation

    - added support for wildcard-based pattern matching of item's filename

0.04  2013-02-17
    - bug fixed: added missing dependency on parent, which is required to import
      Clone module that is used to clone disk directory item object

0.03  2013-02-11
    - added "clone" method that copies an entire D64::Disk::Dir::Item object

0.02  2013-02-09
    - added implementation of "empty" method, which verifies if directory item
      contains information about the actual disk file or not

      item is writable and can be replaced by any new file that would be written
      into disk
